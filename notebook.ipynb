In cases like these, you need to use conditional statements. \"If, else\" statements are in the heart of this topic.\n",

    "    if CONDITIONAL:\n",
    "        STATEMENT1\n",

    "Statements 1,2,3 will be executed if condition is satisfied and statements 4,5 will be executed if the condition is not satisfied. You might have noticed that **if, else** lines are vertically aligned differently than **statement** lines. That is not an arbitrary decision. In Python, you need to carefully indent your code. Because Python interpreter needs to know if a statement is in the **scope** of the **if,else** statement.\n",

But, condition is satisfied or not, statement 2 will always get executed because it's not in the scope of the **if**. It's just another line of code to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to write conditional statements\n",
    "Conditional statements are statements that, when calculated, take the value **True** or **False**. To write conditional statements properly, you need conditional operators. Following are the conditional operators:\n",
    "* ==(double equals) is for _equality_\n",
    "* \\> is for _greater than_\n",

    "* \\>= is for _greater than or equal to_\n",
    "* <= is for _less than or equal to_\n",

    "\n",
    "To take the **not** of a conditional statement, simply add the word **not** in front of it. To make sure you are taking the **not** of the correct thing, you can surround them with parentheses."
